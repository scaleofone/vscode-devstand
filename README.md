# The missing node between understanding and Kubernetes

1. Start with familiar abstractions well-known to any developer:<br>
   - `Web service`
   - `Background worker`
   - `SQL database`
   - `S3 file storage`
2. Links microservices to each other, set ENV variables and public URLs;
3. Transform to full and lengthy Kubernetes manifests ready to deploy!
